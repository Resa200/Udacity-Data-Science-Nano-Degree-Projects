# Used Car Data Exploration
## by Theresa Sunday


## Dataset

> The dataset was gotten from Kaggle.There are 7906 rows and 18 columns in the dataset. Most of the variables are categorical in nature with 'selling_price', 'km_driven', 'mileage', 'engine' and 'max_power' columns as numerical.The main features and target of the dataset is the 'sold' and 'selling_price' column which tells us whether a used car is sold or not and its selling price respectively. Outliers in the dataset were removed from the numerical columns and the dataset reduced to 5877 rows and 18 columns.


## Summary of Findings

> Cars sold tended to have lower selling prices than cars that have not been sold. Higher Km_driven tended to be a characteristic of car not sold yet.Automatic cars had higher selling prices,selling price of vehicles increased as years and engine powers increased.A positive correlation between selling price and max_power which is not surprising as more engine powers generally increase the value of a car.One interesting relationship is the high positive correlation between engine and max power. Cars higher mileage tended to be charactersistics of cars not yet sold. This is a valid point and according to webuycar.com ,the car with higher mileage will have a lower resale value.Diesel and Petrol cars had better engine powers than LPG and CNG fueled cars. Engine power and max engine power is a great characteristic of very expensive cars. Automatic cars , especially diesel operated automatic cars tended to be very expensive.
The max engine power and engine power of automatic cars were very high if compared to that of manual cars.There is an increase in amount of automatic cars purchased from 2005 with blank years being 1998-2004.The blank years suggest that no automatic cars in the dataset was purchased in that period.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Used car prices in the dataset take on a very large range of values, from about  30,000 dollars to about 1,300,000 dollars at the highest. Plotted on a histogram, the distribution of used car prices takes on a unimodal shape.
> Used cars are either sold or not. How do they compare in this dataset? Do people really buy used cars?
> Only 25% of the used cars in the dataset have been sold with a huge 75% not sold.
>Diesel and Petrol fuelled used cars tended to have higher prices than LPG and CNG fuelled cars. Automatic cars in the dataset were more expensive as compared to manual cars.Indivividual cars tended to have lesser prices than dealer used cars. Direct owners cars i.e first owner cars were more expensive than other owner types.
>Very high max engine powers had very high selling prices showing its correlation.Similarly, engine and years also show positive correlation with the selling price.
>Cars with higher mileage had a harder time getting sold than cars with lower mileage
